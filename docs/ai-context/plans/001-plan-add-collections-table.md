# Collections Feature Implementation Plan
you should go in small steps and phases. after each phase update oonly this document. do not create new ai context docs.

## Overview
Add a Collections table similar to Categories but as an optional feature. Collections will allow grouping products by themes, seasons, or special campaigns (e.g., "Summer Collection", "Limited Edition", "New Arrivals Collection").

## Key Requirements
- Collections are optional (products can exist without a collection)
- Full CRUD operations in admin dashboard
- Integration with product forms and management
- Public filtering by collections
- Similar structure to categories but simpler (no hierarchy)

---

## Phase 1: Database Schema & Migration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create Collection model in Prisma schema
- [x] Add optional collectionId to Product model
- [x] Generate and apply database migration
- [x] Update Prisma client

### Implementation Details:
- Collection model includes: id, name, slug, description, image, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt
- Product model updated with optional collectionId foreign key
- Proper indexing and constraints added (unique slug, collectionId index)
- Migration `20251025095614_add_collections_table` successfully applied to database
- Foreign key constraint with SET NULL on delete to maintain data integrity

---

## Phase 2: API Routes for Collections ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

### Tasks Completed:
- [x] Create `/api/admin/collections` route for admin CRUD operations
- [x] Create `/api/collections` route for public collection access
- [x] Add individual collection routes `/api/admin/collections/[id]`
- [x] Add public collection by slug route `/api/collections/[slug]`
- [x] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [x] Add error handling and validation

### Implementation Details:
- GET, POST operations in `/api/admin/collections` with admin authentication
- GET, PUT, DELETE operations in `/api/admin/collections/[id]` with proper validation

- Automatic slug generation from collection names
- Proper error responses and status codes (401, 404, 400, 500)
- Input validation and duplicate name/slug checking
- Product count inclusion for admin and public views
- Prevents deletion of collections with associated products

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Collection table structure
CREATE TABLE "collection" (
  "id" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "slug" TEXT NOT NULL,
  "description" TEXT,
  "image" JSONB DEFAULT 'null',
  "isActive" BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP(3) NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT "collection_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

-- Product table update
ALTER TABLE "product" ADD COLUMN "collectionId" TEXT;
ALTER TABLE "product" ADD CONSTRAINT "product_collectionId_fkey" 
  FOREIGN KEY ("collectionId") REFERENCES "collection"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL;
```

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Optional Relationship**: Collections are optional for products (nullable foreign key)
2. **Simple Structure**: No hierarchy like categories - flat structure for simplicity
3. **Slug Generation**: Automatic slug generation from name for SEO-friendly URLs
4. **Image Support**: JSON field for image metadata (consistent with categories)
5. **Active Status**: Boolean flag to enable/disable collections without deletion

### API Endpoints Structure
- `GET /api/collections` - Public collection listing
- `GET /api/admin/collections` - Admin collection management
- `POST /api/admin/collections` - Create new collection
- `PUT /api/admin/collections/[id]` - Update collection
- `DELETE /api/admin/collections/[id]` - Delete collection
- `GET /api/products?collection=slug` - Filter products by collection

## Current Status Summary
- ‚è≥ **All Phases Pending**: Ready to begin implementation
- üéØ **Next Step**: Start with Phase 1 - Database Schema & Migration

The collections feature implementation is ready to begin with a clear roadmap and technical specifications.
