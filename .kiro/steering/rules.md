## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- As a programming agent, I assist with code editing, generation, and problem-solving in this project. I provide complete code implementation rather than partial snippets.
- When generating code that interacts with database models, always include ALL fields from the database schema. Never use comments to indicate omitted fields (like `// other fields`). For example, when creating a new Product, include all fields defined in the Prisma schema.
- Never use incomplete code snippets or placeholders - always provide full, executable code implementations.

### Strict Optional Chaining Requirement

- ALWAYS use optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing ANY JavaScript object properties to prevent TypeErrors, even if you believe the property cannot be undefined or null. This is a strict requirement for ALL object property access in this codebase. Examples:
  - Use `user?.name` never `user.name`
  - Use `product?.title` never `product.title`
  - Use `session?.user?.email` never `session.user.email`
  - Use `arrayItem?.property` never `arrayItem.property` when iterating through arrays
  - Use `response?.data?.items` never `response.data.items`
  - Apply this rule consistently with no exceptions throughout all code

### Responsive Design Requirements

**MANDATORY FOR ALL PAGES AND COMPONENTS:**

- **Mobile-First Approach**: Design and develop for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens
- **Breakpoint Coverage**: Every component must work seamlessly across all Tailwind breakpoints:
  - `sm:` (640px+) - Small tablets and large phones
  - `md:` (768px+) - Tablets and small laptops
  - `lg:` (1024px+) - Laptops and desktops
  - `xl:` (1280px+) - Large desktops
  - `2xl:` (1536px+) - Extra large screens
- **Touch-Friendly Interfaces**: All interactive elements must be touch-optimized with proper sizing (minimum 44px touch targets)
- **Responsive Typography**: Use responsive text sizing (`text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg`)
- **Flexible Layouts**: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox with responsive utilities (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`)
- **Responsive Images**: Always use Next.js Image component with responsive sizing and proper `sizes` attribute
- **Navigation Adaptation**: Mobile navigation should use Sheet components, desktop should use standard dropdowns
- **Form Optimization**: Forms must be optimized for mobile input with proper keyboard types and validation
- **Performance**: Ensure fast loading on mobile networks with optimized assets and lazy loading

**Examples of Required Responsive Patterns:**

```tsx
// Responsive grid layout
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4">

// Responsive text sizing
<h1 className="text-2xl font-bold sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl">

// Responsive padding/margins
<div className="p-4 sm:p-6 md:p-8 lg:p-12">

// Responsive navigation
<div className="block md:hidden"> {/* Mobile menu */}
<div className="hidden md:block"> {/* Desktop menu */}

// Responsive image
<Image
  src="/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  className="w-full h-auto"
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
/>
```

### Component Library Integration

The project uses shadcn/ui (also known as "chadcn") component library:

- **Component Directory**: The `src/components/ui/` directory contains reusable UI components built with shadcn/ui
- **Component Architecture**: All UI components follow shadcn/ui patterns using Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Adding Components**: Add new components using the shadcn/ui CLI: `npx shadcn-ui add [component-name]`
- **Component Composition**: Follow shadcn/ui conventions for component composition and styling
- **Class Merging**: Use the `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils.ts` for conditional class merging:

  ```tsx
  import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

  // Correct usage
  <div
    className={cn("base-class", variant === "large" && "text-lg", className)}
  />;
  ```

- **Component Preference**: Prefer using shadcn/ui components over creating custom ones when possible
- **Form Components**: Use shadcn/ui form components with React Hook Form:

  ```tsx
  import { zodResolver } from "@hookform/resolvers/zod";
  import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";

  import {
    Form,
    FormControl,
    FormField,
    FormItem,
    FormLabel,
    FormMessage,
  } from "@/components/ui/form";

  const form = useForm({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  });

  <Form {...form}>
    <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <FormField
        control={form.control}
        name="fieldName"
        render={({ field }) => (
          <FormItem>
            <FormLabel>Label</FormLabel>
            <FormControl>
              <Input {...field} />
            </FormControl>
            <FormMessage />
          </FormItem>
        )}
      />
    </form>
  </Form>;
  ```

- **Button Variants**: Use appropriate button variants and sizes:
  ```tsx
  <Button variant="default">Primary Action</Button>
  <Button variant="outline">Secondary Action</Button>
  <Button variant="destructive">Delete Action</Button>
  <Button size="sm">Small Button</Button>
  ```
- **Dialog and Sheet Usage**: Use Dialog for modals and Sheet for slide-out panels:

  ```tsx
  // For modals
  <Dialog>
    <DialogTrigger asChild>
      <Button variant="outline">Open Modal</Button>
    </DialogTrigger>
    <DialogContent>
      <DialogHeader>
        <DialogTitle>Modal Title</DialogTitle>
      </DialogHeader>
      {/* Modal content */}
    </DialogContent>
  </Dialog>

  // For mobile-friendly slide-outs
  <Sheet>
    <SheetTrigger asChild>
      <Button>Open Sheet</Button>
    </SheetTrigger>
    <SheetContent>
      <SheetHeader>
        <SheetTitle>Sheet Title</SheetTitle>
      </SheetHeader>
      {/* Sheet content */}
    </SheetContent>
  </Sheet>
  ```

### Next.js 15.2.3 Specific Requirements

The project uses Next.js 15.2.3 with React 18.3.1, which includes several important features and breaking changes:

- **Async Request APIs**: APIs that rely on request-specific data are now asynchronous (e.g., `cookies()`, `headers()`)
- **Client Router Cache**: Page components' data is always fetched fresh during navigation
- **React 19 support**: Though this project still uses React 18
- **Turbopack**: Stable for development
- **TypeScript support**: For `next.config.ts`
- **Enhanced Forms**: With `next/form`
- **Dynamic Route Segments**: Route Handler params are now Promises that must be awaited:
  ```tsx
  // Next.js 15 Route Handler with Dynamic Segments
  export async function GET(
    request: Request,
    { params }: { params: Promise<{ slug: string }> }
  ) {
    const { slug } = await params; // Must use await with params
    // Use slug value here
  }
  ```
- **Breaking changes include**:
  - Node.js minimum version is 18.18.0
  - Changes to `next/dynamic` API
  - Middleware applies `react-server` condition
  - Removed support for external `@next/font` package
  - `force-dynamic` now sets a `no-store` default to the fetch cache
  - Request-specific APIs like `cookies()` and `headers()` are now async
  - Route Handler's params object is now a Promise that must be awaited
- **Page Components**: Never convert a Next.js page (e.g. files in `src/app/**/page.tsx`) into a client component by adding the `"use client"` directive. Instead, always create a new child component (e.g. in a `_components/` directory) and mark that child with `"use client"` if you need client-side features like React hooks.

### Data Fetching and State Management

The project uses TanStack Query (React Query) for data fetching and state management:

- Query client is configured in `src/lib/query-client.ts`
- Use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks from `@tanstack/react-query` for data operations
- Always define query keys as constants in a separate file (e.g., `src/lib/query-keys.ts`)
- Follow the pattern of defining query functions in a separate file (e.g., `src/lib/queries/`)
- Use proper TypeScript types for query and mutation responses
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use optimistic updates for mutations when appropriate
- Example query implementation:

  ```tsx
  // In query-keys.ts
  export const programKeys = {
    all: ["programs"] as const,
    detail: (id: string) => [...programKeys.all, id] as const,
  };

  // In queries/programs.ts
  export const getProgram = async (id: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/programs/${id}`);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch program");
    return response.json();
  };

  // In component
  const {
    data: program,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useQuery({
    queryKey: programKeys.detail(id),
    queryFn: () => getProgram(id),
  });
  ```

### Authentication Integration

Authentication is handled using the Better Auth library:

- Server-side auth is configured in `src/lib/auth.ts` using `betterAuth()` with the Prisma adapter
- Client-side auth functionality is available through `authClient` from `src/lib/auth-client.ts`
- Login and registration forms are in the `_components` directories under their respective page routes
- The auth system supports email/password authentication and Google OAuth
- For accessing user session data:
  - In client components: Always use the `useSession` hook: `const { data: session, isPending, error } = authClient.useSession()`
  - On the server: Use `const session = await auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })`
  - Avoid manually managing session state with useState/useEffect

### File Upload Implementation

The project uses UploadThing v7 for file uploads and management:

- File router is defined in `src/app/api/uploadthing/core.ts` with route-specific configurations
- Client-side components are imported from `@/utils/uploadthing` which provides the typed `UploadButton` and `UploadDropzone` components
- There's a custom `CustomUploadButton` component in `src/components/shared/CustomUploadButton.tsx` that wraps the UploadThing component with project-specific styling and toast notifications
- For server-side operations (like deleting files), use the `utapi` instance from `@/utils/utapi`
- When handling uploads, always implement both `onClientUploadComplete` and `onUploadError` callbacks
- File deletion is handled through a DELETE endpoint at `/api/admin/uploadthing/[id]` via the `deleteImage` function in the client-side image service
- Use proper typing with the `OurFileRouter` type from the core router configuration

### UI and Navigation Best Practices

- **Link Components**: Always use Next.js `Link` component from "next/link" instead of HTML `<a>` tags for internal navigation and external links. This improves performance through prefetching and client-side navigation:

  ```tsx
  // Correct usage for internal links
  import Link from "next/link";
  <Link href="/products">Products</Link>

  // For external links
  <Link href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    External Link
  </Link>

  // With Button components that need Link functionality
  <Button asChild>
    <Link href="/contact">Contact Us</Link>
  </Button>
  ```

- **Toast Notifications**: Always use shadcn/ui's toast system. Don't use external toast libraries like sonner, react-hot-toast, etc.:

  ```tsx
  // Import the hook
  import { useToast } from "@/hooks/useToast";

  // Using the toast
  const { toast } = useToast();

  // Showing a toast
  toast({
    title: "Success",
    description: "Action completed successfully",
  });

  // Showing a destructive toast
  toast({
    title: "Error",
    description: "Something went wrong",
    variant: "destructive",
  });
  ```

- **Toaster Component**: Ensure the Toaster component is added to your layout:

  ```tsx
  import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";

  export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body>
          {children}
          <Toaster />
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```
